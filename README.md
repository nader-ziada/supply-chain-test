# supply-chain-test

 - the `cluster-supply-chain-alm` uses a carvelpkg-build step to create a carvel package and then sends that over to the following task which is a config-writer to create a PR

 - the gitops should be configured in the tap-values files as follows for an example

 ```yaml
 ootb_supply_chain_basic:
  gitops:
    server_address: https://github.com/
    repository_owner: <user-name>
    repository_name: <gitops-repo-name>
    branch: main
    commit_strategy: pull_request
    pull_request:
      server_kind: github
      commit_branch: ""
      pull_request_title: ready for review
      pull_request_body: generated by supply chain
 ```

 - the service account used has registery-credentials secret that gives it access to the container registery for pushing images

- The image used for the tekton task is the modified scripting base generated fron tge Dockerfile in this repo

#### Outstanding:

 - passing the package version and other paramaters from tge workload resource to the generated package
